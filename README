mvStore setup

This directory will contain the various setup options for each
platform.  Until the project becomes open, a few preliminary
steps will be required:

 * the user must have a personal (free) github account
   and must be registered as one of the 10 collaborators
 * in his github account, the user must have a ssh keypair 
   duly registered, and properly setup on the machine
   where he wishes to run the setup
 * the user must be a sudoer (/etc/sudoers)
 * the user must have already installed git
   (n.b. setup.sh itself shows how to do this on the
   supported platforms)
 * the user can now proceed, after cloning the setup project:

     git clone git@github.com:mvStore/setup.git
     bash ./setup/linux/setup.sh

Most of these manual steps will become unnecessary when we
open-source: the setup script will be obtained with curl
via https://raw.github.com (no credential required), 
and it will make sure git is installed.
