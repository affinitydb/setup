Affinity setup

This directory contains the various code setup options for each
platform.  A few preliminary steps are required:

 * the user must have a personal github account
 * the user must be a sudoer (/etc/sudoers)

Then do:

  git clone git@github.com:affinitydb/setup.git
  bash ./setup/linux/setup.sh

Soon the setup script will be obtained with curl
via https://raw.github.com (no credential required), 
and it will make sure git is installed.
